TITLE OF PROBLEM STATEMENT:
TO AUTOMATE AND COMPUTE THE DETECTION OF POSSIBLE VULNERABILITY TO DEPRESSION
BEFORE ITS ONSET


SHORT DESCRIPTION:
Web App that works on maximum available devices. providing a platform where users can check
their mental health issues .Accurately predict if they are suffering or about to suffer a mental health
issue such as depression.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
As per WHO, Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the
overall global burden of disease. With the rising spread of COVID19 and peak in the awareness of
mental health, there is a vast increase in the subclinical population. The earlier the detection, the
earlier the intervention can stunt the symptoms. Using machine learning, the process is quick and
shows higher accuracy. To develop a high-accuracy Computer Aided Diagnosis Model using Support
Vector Machine Learning (SVML). This Model should measure DTI MRI scans of mood- affected and
non-affected individuals. It should read the structure and neural connections of the brain of
individuals with Depression (as per ICD10). The expected accuracy of the model should be 75% and
above. The accuracy of the model should be evaluated using supervised methods to evaluate the
three dimensional vectors and quantify the dominant fibre orientation. A suitable and large dataset
requires to be procured to work on this problem statement.


OUTCOME EXPECTED:
1. Develop a web app that provides users with an interface where they can interact and input
various parameters that help in predicting mental health issues.
2. Create a server that collects current user data for further analysis and monitoring
3. Use available data sets of previous victims and use them to predict the mental health issues
of current users
